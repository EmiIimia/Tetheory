High Tinfoil Theory: Free Acquisition as a Signal

* **Xiangli Yao Precedent:** Kuro Games *has* previously given away a *new limited 5-star character* (Xiangli Yao) for free via a major patch event (1.2). This proves they *can* prioritize engagement/goodwill over direct banner revenue sometimes.
* **The "Bold Move" Argument:** Given the competitive market and the deliberate anniversary timing, a free Cartethyia (perhaps via limited even to finish the 2.4 questline) *could* be rationalized as an unprecedented "bold move" to secure player loyalty and signal her immense narrative importance/intended permanence as a companion. The surrounding monetization (copies, weapon, skins, other banners) *could* partially offset the C0 loss.
* **Acquisition Method Secrecy:** Plumbing insulation around her *could* potentially be related to hiding an unconventional acquisition method.
* **Likelihood:** Despite the precedent and strategic arguments, this remains **highly speculative ("tinfoil") and unlikely** compared to a standard banner release due to the significant financial risk. (Estimated Chance: 15-25% at most).
