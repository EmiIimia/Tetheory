# Theory: Parallels Between Yangyang (Beta) and Cartethyia - A Narrative Refinement?

While Yangyang serves as Rover's initial guide in the live version of Wuthering Waves, her role in earlier Closed Beta Tests (CBTs) was reportedly more akin to a constant traveling companion, featuring significant dramatic moments. Intriguingly, many aspects of this beta portrayal, particularly a key sacrificial act, bear striking resemblances to Cartethyia's pivotal moments in the patch 2.2 storyline. This raises the possibility that Cartethyia represents a narrative refinement or successful realization of the companion archetype initially explored with Yangyang. She was clearly placed in 1.0 as someone that accompanied rover given the nature of her also being the app icon this could be a sign of it. 

## I. Shared Archetype: The Aero Sword Maiden

* **Element:** Both Yangyang and Cartethyia are **Aero** element Resonators. This element is often thematically associated with freedom, agility, and support, but also capable of offensive power.
* **Weapon:** Both characters primarily wield **Swords**.
* **Tacet Mark Location:** Both characters notably have their Tacet Mark located on their **forehead**.
* **Initial Impression:** Both are presented as relatively gentle, kind figures who form an early or significant bond with Rover. Or at least attempt to and fall flat with players in yangyangs case. 

While shared elements/weapons exist among characters, the combination of Aero, Sword, and the distinct forehead Tacet Mark creates a noticeable overlap in their fundamental design archetype.

## II. The Pivotal Sacrifice Parallel (Beta Yangyang vs. Live Cartethyia)

This is the most compelling point of comparison:

* **Beta Yangyang Scenario:** During early story in CBTs, Rover and their initial party (including Yangyang) reportedly faced the first major boss, Crownless. In this version, the party struggled, and Crownless overwhelmed them. To protect Rover, Yangyang pushed herself beyond her limits, potentially **Overclocking** her abilities. This act of sacrifice allowed Rover a chance to fight back and caused Crownless to falter, but resulted in Yangyang fainting and becoming severely weakened. Rover, witnessing this sacrifice, was then depicted gaining resolve or power to defeat Crownless.
* **Live Cartethyia Scenario (Patch 2.2):** During the climax against Fleurdelys, Rover is trapped and overwhelmed. Cartethyia, after resolving her internal conflict, intervenes to save him. She explicitly attempts to **Overclock** (potentially triggering a Second Resonance Awakening) to break Rover's cage. This massive exertion weakens Fleurdelys's hold enough for Rover to break free but leaves Cartethyia collapsing and vulnerable. Rover catches her, and in her final moments before fading/fusing, she transfers her power/essence to him, becoming his "blade" and enabling his victory.

* **The Parallel:** The core beats are remarkably similar:
    1.  Rover is facing defeat against a major antagonist.
    2.  The Aero/Sword companion pushes beyond their limits (Overclocking) in a desperate act to save/enable Rover.
    3.  This act weakens the enemy's hold and/or directly empowers Rover.
    4.  The companion collapses or fades as a result.
    5.  Rover, fueled by this sacrifice/empowerment, achieves victory.

The fact that this dramatic sequence was present for Yangyang in beta, removed for her in the live game (where Rover handles Crownless like a bug), and then implemented almost identically but with higher stakes for Cartethyia is highly suggestive of narrative repurposing or refinement.

## III. Thematic Links: Aero and Freedom

* The Aero element often carries connotations of freedom, wind, and unbound movement.
* Cartethyia's entire arc is fundamentally about achieving **freedom** – freedom from her imposed fate by Leviathan, freedom from her past identity as Fleurdelys, freedom from despair, and the freedom to choose her own path and purpose (her vow to Rover).
* While Yangyang also seeks freedom in her own way (from her past), Cartethyia's story makes the Aero element's connection to freedom much more central and explicit. She *is* the embodiment of breaking chains, aligning perfectly with the element's symbolism.

## IV. Narrative Context: A Potential Shift Across Patches?

* **Beta Yangyang:** Positioned as a constant companion, deeply involved in early dramatic moments like the Crownless fight sacrifice.
* **Live Yangyang (Patch 1.0 - Launch, May 2024):** Serves as Rover's first contact and guide through the initial Jinzhou quests. The dramatic sacrifice beat against Crownless is removed; Rover defeats the boss more directly. Yangyang's role feels more supportive/informational. Player reception to her dialogue/VA is mixed. Her staying to fight the enemies away from Jiyan and Rover is essentially a nothingburger. Only seen as kind. Named YapYap by many. 
* **Patch 1.1 (Jinhsi Arc, Late June/July 2024):** Focus shifts heavily to Jinhsi and the Sentinel Jué. Yangyang is largely absent from the main questline, unable to follow Rover into areas affected by time dilation, separation from Rover's core challenges. This timing (~1-2 months post-launch) is likely too early for major narrative rewrites based on launch reception.
* **Patch 1.2 (Festival Filler, Aug/Sept 2024):** Primarily a festival event patch with less focus on main plot progression. Yangyang appears in event context but not significantly advance a companion role.
* **Patch 1.3 (Black Shores, Sept/Oct 2024):** This marks a potential turning point (~4-5 months post-launch, enough time for developers to react to feedback and adjust plans). Despite being present with Rover, Yangyang is pointedly *not* teleported alongside him by Shorekeeper to the new Black Shores area. This creates a clear narrative separation, leaving Rover to explore the new zone alone. This feels like a deliberate choice to sideline her from the immediate adventure. Retconned?
* **Patch 1.4 (Filler/Companion Quests, Nov/Dec 2024):** Cammy patch with train Illusive realm, no yangyang in the train. 
* **Patch 2.0 (Rinascita Intro, Jan 2025):** Introduces the new major region, Rinascita. While focusing on new characters (Carlotta, Roccia), the end of the main questline provides the first significant encounter with **Cartethyia**.
* **Patch 2.1 (Filler/Fishing, Feb/March 2025):** Continues building Rinascita characters (Phoebe, Brant)  through their own story quests or events. 
* **Patch 2.2 (Cartethyia Arc, March/April 2025):** The main story focus swings dramatically to **Cartethyia**, exploring her backstory, the mysteries of Avinoleum and the Imperator and Levithan, and culminating in the intense climax featuring the sacrifice/empowerment beat strongly reminiscent of beta Yangyang's removed scene. This happens despite *Cantarella* being the banner character.
* **The Theory:** The timeline suggests a potential pivot point around patch 1.3, where Yangyang's role as a primary traveling companion was diminished (possibly influenced by reception). The compelling dramatic potential of the sacrificial beat was then held and later implemented with much greater narrative weight and higher stakes within Cartethyia's arc in patch 2.2, strongly positioning *her* as the character intended to fulfill the deep, dramatically significant companion role moving forward.

## V. Conclusion

The striking parallels in archetype (Aero/Sword/Forehead Mark) and, most importantly, the near-identical dramatic structure of the sacrificial Overclocking moment between beta Yangyang and live Cartethyia, strongly suggest more than coincidence. Combined with Cartethyia's powerful embodiment of Aero's freedom theme and the context of Yangyang's diminished narrative role across patches 1.0-2.2, it builds a compelling case that Cartethyia represents a deliberate narrative refinement. She appears positioned to fulfill the potential of the deeply connected, dramatically significant traveling companion archetype that was perhaps initially explored, but ultimately set aside, with Yangyang. This strengthens the argument for Cartethyia having a planned, recurring role alongside Rover moving forward.
