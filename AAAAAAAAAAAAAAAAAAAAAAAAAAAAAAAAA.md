1. If you look at every other drip they all have a role in the first line

- **Jinhsi**: Being the *Magistrate of Jinzhou*, Jinhsi bears her noble and weighty share of duties.  
- **Zhezhi**: A commissioned painter.  
- **Huaxu**: Academy's Principal Investigator.  
- **Xiangli Yao**: The *Shorekeeper of the Black Shores*.  
- **Carlotta**: The second daughter of the esteemed Montelli family.  
- **Roccia**: A gifted improvisational comedian and the *First Mate of the Fool's Troupe*.  
- **Brant**: As captain of the *Fool's Troupe*.  
- **Cantarella Fisalia**: The Fisalia family's thirty-sixth head.  
- **Phoebe**: An *Acolyte of the Order of the Deep*.  
- **Zani**: A serious and reliable *Montelli employee*.  
- **Ciaccona**: The *bard of Rinascita*.  
- **Lupa**: The *star gladiator of Septimont*, a warrior with a pure heart.

Yet **Cartethyia's** is vague:

> *"The powers of the Sentinel and Threnodian clash and unite within her, propelling her into an uncertain future."*

**Why?**  
Keep in mind she is described as a **"knight"** in CN.  
Itâ€™s focused **only on her nature and power** rather than a place or institution she belongs to.

Yet **Lupa** is **fully revealed** despite her region and lore being a heavy spoiler???

2. **Aerover** is literally useless without a "certain unit".  
The **entire free sword** is given to him for **one thing**.  
His **outro** has **one use**.  
His **status conversion** facilitates **that one use**.  
He himself applies **frazzle on Spectro**, and he can convert to **erosion in story** if it comes to it.

**2.5.**  
**IF YOU THINK SHE IS GOING BACK TO THE ORDER YOU'RE FUCKING RETARDED.**

---

3. Her **crown** is the **only one getting reformed** in the teaser  
**After going through decay** into a **bluer color (symbolizing purity)**

> *"Embark on the journey that marks the start of every hero's tale."*

**WHO IS THE HERO??**  
It's **not Rover** **his journey is ongoing.**

**IS IT ACTUALLY FUCKING HAPPENING?????????????????**  
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**
